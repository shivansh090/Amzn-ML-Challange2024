## Problem Overview
In the fast-paced world of e-commerce, obtaining accurate product details from images is critical, particularly when text descriptions are incomplete or absent. This is not limited to e-commerce but also impacts areas such as healthcare and content moderation, where precise data like product dimensions, weight, and volume play a vital role in decision-making and operational efficiency.

This hackathon challenge aims to develop a machine learning model that accurately extracts and predicts key entity values such as weight, volume, and dimensions from product images. These values are crucial for enhancing the quality of digital marketplaces and improving user experience. The model will be evaluated based on its ability to reproduce the ground truth using the F1 score.

## Solution Overview
The solution involves building a machine learning pipeline that combines image preprocessing, optical character recognition (OCR), and pattern matching to extract relevant entity values from images. The core of the solution is based on EasyOCR, a widely-used text extraction library, enhanced by several image processing techniques to improve text clarity and recognition accuracy.

### Solution Algorithm
1. **Image Retrieval and Preprocessing:**
   - Fetch the image from a URL.
   - Convert the image to grayscale and apply adaptive preprocessing techniques (brightness adjustment, contrast enhancement, and sharpening) based on the image's properties (e.g., brightness and edge intensity).
   
2. **Text Detection and Extraction:**
   - Use EasyOCR to detect and extract text from the processed image.
   - Correct common OCR misreads (e.g., replacing misread characters like 'o' with '0').
   
3. **Pattern Matching for Attributes:**
   - Use regex patterns to detect entity values (e.g., weight, volume, dimensions) from the extracted text.
   - Convert short forms of units (e.g., "kg", "lb") to their full forms for consistency.
   
4. **Attribute Prediction:**
   - Match the extracted text to the desired attribute (e.g., weight, volume) using predefined regex patterns.
   - Return the predicted entity value in the desired format (e.g., "1.5 kilograms").

5. **Evaluation:**
   - Compare the predicted values with the ground truth using an F1 score to evaluate the model's accuracy.
  
### Key Features:
- **OCR with EasyOCR**: Leverages advanced OCR to extract text from images.
- **Regex for Pattern Matching**: Accurately identifies units like weight, volume, and dimensions from the detected text.
- **Adaptive Preprocessing**: Dynamically adjusts image properties like brightness and sharpness to optimize OCR performance.
  
### Usage
To use this model:
1. Import the required libraries.
2. Call the `imgtotext(image_url, attribute)` function to extract the required attribute (e.g., weight, volume) from an image.
3. Evaluate the model's performance based on F1 score or accuracy by comparing the predicted values against the actual values.

This solution can be extended to various fields, such as e-commerce platforms, inventory management systems, and healthcare for efficient data extraction from images where precise measurements are required.
